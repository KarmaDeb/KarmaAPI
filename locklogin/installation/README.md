# Installation

But before going to the installation, you might need to know a few things

> LockLogin uses a licensing system to comunicate betwen plugin instances, this is a completely free service, and it's invisible for you, you won't notice anything. \
> But there's a problem with that, and is that the license, is generated everytime you download the plugin, so if you download the plugin twice, and install the different instances in servers which are part of a same network, the plugin instances won't be able to comunicate as they won't have the same license.\
> \
> Aforuntately, LockLogin though in that, and there're some ways to fix such scenarios. Those fixes are specified in each installation scenario
