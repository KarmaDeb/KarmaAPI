  LockLogin uses modules to use its API. That way the plugin is able to record
  everything that happens, so you can later check if a module is doing
  suspicious actions

# ðŸ”Œ Modules

LockLogin modules are small pieces of software designed to work with LockLogin, these modules are specifically designed to work with LockLogin and cannot be used with any other software.

In simple terms, a module is like an add-on that extends the functionality of LockLogin. For example, a module may be created to add a "forgot password" command, or interact directly with the player.

Since LockLogin modules are built specifically for use with LockLogin, they are able to access the LockLogin API (Application Programming Interface), which is a set of programming instructions that allows different software programs to communicate with each other. This means that the module can work seamlessly with LockLogin, providing additional security features for your Minecraft server.

Overall, LockLogin modules are a powerful tool for Minecraft server administrators who want to improve the security of their server. They provide a way to add new authentication methods, integrate with third-party security systems, and extend the functionality of LockLogin.
